<b>How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?</b>

The easiest way to ensure code is functional is simply by running it. While this doesn't guarantee that it's working exactly as intended or without flaws, it does let you know you are on the right path and things are working. Regarding it being secure, there are several things that can and should be done to ensure that the software is secure. Static testing, dynamic testing, and even pentesting are all great ways of looking for things like vulnerabilities in your program. Maven dependency checks are something that I have used. Manual code reviews are also important because it allows you to see where you are failing at things like input validation.

<b>How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?</b>

Once you are sent requirements by the client, you must run through the document and break down each main point. It's good to have a clear list that you can reference back to easily. Once you have that set, you will want to explore solutions that will be the best for their needs and budget.

<b>How do I approach designing software?</b>

I always start out by reading over the requirements and get a good understanding of what the client wants and needs. I personally will create a list of everything that I need to meet and what solutions I am thinking of. This makes it easy for me to look at it and check off items instead of having to dig through a document or have to go back and interpret what the client meant again. Then I will get my code base going after I have a clear plan and requirements and test every so often. I try to limit how much code I write before testing because it makes it easier to fix than if I were to spend hours writing without testing. I try to always keep testing in mind as I'm plotting how I will approach my code I also think of how I will want to test that section. If I write up code first and don't think of testing I am going to likely just cost myself time that I won't have.
